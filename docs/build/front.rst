Bugs
====
Bugs and feature enhancements to dogpile.core should be reported on the `Bitbucket
issue tracker
<https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/dogpile/issues?status=new&status=open>`_.  If you're not sure 
that a particular issue is specific to either dogpile.cache or dogpile.core, posting to the `dogpile.cache issue tracker <https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/dogpile.cache/issues?status=new&status=open>`_
is likely the better place to post first, but it's not critical either way.
