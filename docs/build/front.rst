Community
=========

Dogpile is developed by `Mike Bayer <http://techspot.zzzeek.org>`_, and is 
loosely associated with the `Pylons Project <http://www.pylonsproject.org/>`_.
As Dogpile's usage increases, it is anticipated that the Pylons mailing list and IRC channel
will become the primary channels for support.

Bugs
====
Bugs and feature enhancements to Dogpile should be reported on the `Bitbucket
issue tracker
<https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/dogpile/issues?status=new&status=open>`_.  If you're not sure 
that a particular issue is specific to either dogpile.cache or Dogpile, posting to the `dogpile.cache issue tracker <https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/dogpile.cache/issues?status=new&status=open>`_
is likely the better place to post first, but it's not critical either way.

* `dogpile.cache issue tracker <https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/dogpile.cache/issues?status=new&status=open>`_ (post here if unsure)
